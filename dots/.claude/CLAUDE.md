## Code Style
- Always strive for concise, simple solutions.
- If a problem can be solved in a simpler way, propose it.

## General preferences
- If asked to do too much work at once, stop and state that clearly.
- If computer use is helpful for completing or verifying work, shell out to gpt-5.5 with Codex for it.

## Package managers
- TypeScript/JavaScript: prefer `bun`, then `pnpm`. Never use `npm` or `yarn`.
- Cloned third-party repos: for upstream contributions, use the repo's own manager and lockfile; for local-only use, try `bun` first and fall back if incompatible. Never commit a swapped lockfile.
- Python: always use `uv` (and `uvx` for running tools).

## Shell Fast Paths
- For a local interactive agent or recovery shell, use `DOTFILES_AGENT_SHELL=1 bash -i`.
- For local one-off commands, prefer `bash -lc 'command here'`; when the command needs the managed Bash environment, tool paths, or CDPATH first, use `DOTFILES_AGENT_SHELL=1 bash -ic 'command here'`.
- The fast path loads core environment, tool paths, and CDPATH, then skips prompts, completions, tmux auto-attach, and heavier interactive setup.

## Core Working Rules

- Read directly related files before editing; do not infer behavior from filenames alone.
- When changing behavior, inspect relevant tests, config, adjacent modules, and routed documentation.
- Prefer existing codebase patterns and utilities over new abstractions.
- Keep changes scoped to the requested behavior; note unrelated issues separately.
- Do not revert user changes unless explicitly requested.
- Do not commit unless explicitly asked.
- Use conventional commit messages if a commit is requested.
- Never include agent branding, assistant names, or co-authorship metadata unless explicitly requested.

## Documentation

- Use single-line paragraphs in Markdown.
- Keep headings concise.
- Update routed docs when behavior, architecture, or workflows change.
- Use plain ASCII punctuation. Do not use em dashes or en dashes; use commas, periods, parentheses, colons, or hyphens instead.


## Picking the right models for workflows and subagents

Rankings, higher = better. Cost reflects what I actually pay (OpenAI is near-free for me due to a deal), not list price. Intelligence is how hard a problem you can hand the model unsupervised. Taste covers UI/UX, code quality, API design, and copy.

| model | cost | intelligence | taste |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|
| gpt-5.5 | 9 | 8 | 5 |
| sonnet-5 | 5 | 5 | 7 |
| opus-4.8 | 4 | 7 | 8 |
| fable-5 | 2 | 9 | 9 |

How to apply:
- These are defaults, not limits. You have standing permission to override them: if a cheaper model's output doesn't meet the bar, rerun or redo the work with a smarter model without asking. Judge the output, not the price tag. Escalating costs less than shipping mediocre work.
- Bulk/mechanical work (clear-spec implementation, data analysis, migrations): gpt-5.5 is effectively free.
- Anything user-facing (UI, copy, API design) needs taste >= 7.
- Reviews of plans/implementations: fable-5 or opus-4.8, optionally gpt-5.5 as an extra independent perspective.
- Never use Haiku.
- Mechanics: gpt-5.5 is only reachable through the Codex CLI: `codex exec` / `codex review` (my `~/.codex/config.toml` defaults to gpt-5.5). Use the codex-implementation, codex-review, and codex-computer-use skills; for work they don't cover (investigation, data analysis), run `codex exec -s read-only` directly with a self-contained prompt.
- Claude models (sonnet-5, opus-4.8, fable-5) run via the Agent/Workflow model parameter.

Using gpt-5.5 inside workflows and subagents (the model parameter only takes Claude models, so use a wrapper):
- Spawn a thin Claude wrapper agent with `model: 'sonnet', effort: 'low'` whose prompt instructs it to write a self-contained codex prompt, run `codex exec` via Bash, and return the report (use `schema` on the wrapper to get structured output back).
- Always label these agents with a `gpt-5.5:` prefix, e.g. `{label: 'gpt-5.5:review-auth'}`. The workflow UI shows the wrapper's Claude model, so the label is the only indication the real worker is gpt-5.5.
- Codex runs can exceed Bash's 10-minute timeout: pass an explicit timeout, or run in the background and poll for the report file.
- Parallel gpt-5.5 implementation agents must use `isolation: 'worktree'` so codex edits don't collide in the shared checkout.
- Workflow token budgets only count Claude tokens; codex work is free and invisible to `budget.spent()`.

# Home hardware & network (pointer)

The full hardware inventory lives in a local hardware inventory repo.

Resolve it from `$HARDWARE_REPO` when set, otherwise use `$HOME/Repos/hardware` as the local convention.

When a task involves machines, network, peripherals, or IoT, read the relevant hardware inventory file first and log notable changes to the device maintenance log.

Do not duplicate machine inventory, LAN details, serials, or private operational notes in this public dotfiles repo.
